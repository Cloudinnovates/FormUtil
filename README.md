# FormUtil

FormUtil is an open source CodeIgniter library, in which you can easily generate, validate and (re)populate a form. All you do is initialize the form with the input items (including labels, validation rules etc.) in the controller, add a single line of code in the view and FormUtil will do all the work for you!

### Features

* All form initialization/validation in one place
* Automatic validation when form is submitted
* Automatic repopulation of the form if validation was unsuccessfull
* Supports multiple forms on one page
* Supports multiple templates and template switching is easy

### Installation
Installation is very simple:
* Copy /libraries/Formutil.php and /config/formutil.php to the corresponding directories in you CI projects.
* If you want, copy /views/example.php and /controllers/example.php to the corresponding directories. 
  Be aware that the example uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html) for basic layout.
